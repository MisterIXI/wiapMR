For MRTK basics you should mainly follow Microsofts own tutorials on MRTK intros:
[Introduction to the Mixed Reality Toolkit--Set Up Your Project and Use Hand Interaction - Training | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/learn-mrtk-tutorials/1-1-introduction?tabs=openxr&ns-enrollment-type=learningpath&ns-enrollment-id=learn.azure.beginner-hololens-2-tutorials)
