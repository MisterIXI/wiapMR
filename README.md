# Mixed Reality Tabletop - a university project
A university project about VR/AR (Mixed reality). This project utilizes the [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) 3D engine, [Photon PUN 2](https://www.photonengine.com/en-US/PUN) and [MRTK](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/).

It is a barebones online multiplayer tabletop platform. You can import a custom game and gamepieces and then spawn them and play. Currently due to time constraints it is limited in functionality, but it could pretty easily be expanded upon.

# Project tree
In this project there are three folders:
- `MR_Unity`  -> the actual unity project (created in Unity 2021.3.6f1)
- `WIAP_ObsidianVault` -> the project documentation (partly in german) - done in [ObsidianMD](https://obsidian.md/) but readable on github and other markdown readers/editors
- `Wiap_PUN_Tutorial` -> the unity project created for the german PUN tutorial in the ObsidianVault
